# Short Workspace Path Plugin

[Folders](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin) are a great way to organize jobs in Jenkins. Unfortunately, they quickly result in very long paths that may impact builds e.g. on Windows. This plugin helps with that, allowing users to opt-in to short workspace paths on a per-folder basis.
